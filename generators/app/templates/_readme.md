## A Quando Project

Welcome to your little Quando project.

Here's the lay of the land: it's pretty rough out here. Not a lot of awesome features that Quando is giving you as of yet. But that's allright because hey at least this is now a fully heroku-ready Express app that uses React+Webpack.

### Dev Server

Run `webpack-dev-server` and you'll have a nice little development server running at `localhost:8080`. It's hard as nails and will livereload your shit. Pretty hype.

### Adding Images and shit

If you want to add an image or something you have to (very) awkwardly `require()` it in. More to come...
